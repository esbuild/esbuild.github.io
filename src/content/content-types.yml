title: Content Types
body:
  - h1: Content Types
  - p: >
      All of the built-in content types are listed below. Each content type
      has an associated "loader" which tells esbuild how to interpret the
      file contents. Some file extensions already have a loader configured
      for them by default, although the defaults can be overridden.

  - h2: JavaScript
  - p: 'Loader: `js`'

  - p: >
      This loader is enabled by default for `.js`, `.cjs`, and `.mjs` files.
      The `.cjs` extension is used by node for CommonJS modules and the `.mjs`
      extension is used by node for ECMAScript modules, although esbuild
      doesn't make a distinction between the two.

  - p: >
      All modern JavaScript syntax is supported by esbuild. Newer syntax may
      not be supported by older browsers, however, so you may want to
      configure the [target](/api/#target) option to tell esbuild to convert
      newer syntax to older syntax as appropriate.

  - p: >
      These syntax features are always transformed for older browsers:

  - h3: JavaScript caveats

  - p: >
      You should keep the following things in mind when using JavaScript with
      esbuild:

  - h4#es5: ES5 is not supported well
  - p: >
      Transforming ES6+ syntax to ES5 is not supported yet. However, if you're
      using esbuild to transform ES5 code, you should still set the
      [target](/api/#target) to `es5`. This prevents esbuild from introducing
      ES6 syntax into your ES5 code. For example, without this flag the object
      literal `{x: x}` will become `{x}` and the string `"a\nb"` will become
      a multi-line template literal when minifying. Both of these substitutions
      are done because the resulting code is shorter, but the substitutions
      will not be performed if the [target](/api/#target) is `es5`.

  - h4: Private member performance
  - p: >
      The private member transform (for the `#name` syntax) uses `WeakMap` and
      `WeakSet` to preserve the privacy properties of this feature. This is
      similar to the corresponding transforms in the Babel and TypeScript
      compilers. Most modern JavaScript engines (V8, JavaScriptCore, and
      SpiderMonkey but not ChakraCore) may not have good performance
      characteristics for large `WeakMap` and `WeakSet` objects.
  - p: >
      Creating many instances of classes with private fields or private
      methods with this syntax transform active may cause a lot of overhead
      for the garbage collector.
      This is because modern engines (other than ChakraCore) store weak
      values in an actual map object instead of as hidden properties on the
      keys themselves, and large map objects can cause performance issues with
      garbage collection. See [this reference](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/issues/1657#issuecomment-518916579)
      for more information.

  - h4#direct-eval: Avoid direct `eval` when bundling
  - p: >
      Although the expression `eval(x)` looks like a normal function call, it
      actually takes on special behavior in JavaScript. Using `eval` in this way
      means that the evaluated code stored in `x` can reference any variable in
      any containing scope by name. For example, the code <code>let y = <wbr>123; <wbr>return <wbr>eval('y')</code>
      will return `123`.
  - p: >
      This is called "direct eval" and is problematic when bundling your code
      for many reasons:
  - ul:
    - >
      <p>
      Modern bundlers contain an optimization called "scope hoisting" that
      merges all bundled files into a single file and renames variables to
      avoid name collisions. However, this means code evaluated by direct
      `eval` can read and write variables in any file in the bundle! This
      is a correctness issue because the evaluated code may try to access
      a global variable but may accidentally access a private variable
      with the same name from another file instead. It can potentially even
      be a security issue if a private variable in another file has sensitive
      data.
      </p>
    - >
      <p>
      The evaluated code may not work correctly when it references variables
      imported using an `import` statement. Imported variables are live
      bindings to variables in another file. They are not copies of those
      variables. So when esbuild bundles your code, your imports are replaced
      with a direct reference to the variable in the imported file. But that
      variable may have a different name, in which case the code evaluated by
      direct `eval` will be unable to reference it by the expected name.
      </p>
    - >
      <p>
      Using direct `eval` forces esbuild to deoptimize all of the code in
      all of the scopes containing calls to direct `eval`. For correctness,
      it must assume that the evaluated code might need to access any of the
      other code in the file reachable from that `eval` call. This means
      none of that code will be eliminated as dead code and none of that code
      will be minified.
      </p>
    - >
      <p>
      Because the code evaluated by the direct `eval` could need to reference
      any reachable variable by name, esbuild is prevented from renaming
      all of the variables reachable by the evaluated code. This means it
      can't rename variables to avoid name collisions with other variables
      in the bundle. So the direct `eval` causes esbuild to wrap the file
      in a CommonJS closure, which avoids name collisions by introducing
      a new scope instead. However, this makes the generated code bigger and
      slower because exported variables use run-time dynamic binding instead
      of compile-time static binding.
      </p>
  - p: >
      Luckily it is usually easy to avoid using direct `eval`. There are two
      commonly-used alternatives that avoid all of the drawbacks mentioned
      above:
  - ul:
    - >
      `(0, eval)('x')`
      <p>
      This is known as "indirect eval" because `eval` is not being called
      directly, and so does not trigger the grammatical special case for
      direct eval in the JavaScript VM. You can call indirect eval using any
      syntax at all except for an expression of the exact form `eval('x')`.
      For example, <code>var eval2 = <wbr>eval; <wbr>eval2('x')</code> and
      <code>[eval]\[0]('x')</code> and <code>window.<wbr>eval('x')</code> are
      all indirect eval calls. When you use indirect eval, the code is
      evaluated in the global scope instead of in the inline scope of the
      caller.
      </p>
    - >
      `new Function('x')`
      <p>
      This constructs a new function object at run-time. It is as if you wrote
      <code>function() <wbr>{ x }</code> in the global scope except that `x`
      can be an arbitrary string of code. This form is sometimes convenient
      because you can add arguments to the function, and use those arguments
      to expose variables to the evaluated code. For example,
      <code>(new Function('env', <wbr>'x'))(<wbr>someEnv)</code> is as if you
      wrote <code>(function(env) <wbr>{ x })(<wbr>someEnv)</code>. This is
      often a sufficient alternative for direct `eval` when the evaluated
      code needs to access local variables because you can pass the local
      variables in as arguments.
      </p>

  - h2: TypeScript
  - p: 'Loader: `ts` or `tsx`'

  - p: >
      This loader is enabled by default for `.ts` and `.tsx` files, which
      means esbuild has built-in support for parsing TypeScript syntax and
      discarding the type annotations. However, esbuild _does not_ do any type
      checking so you will still need to run `tsc -noEmit` in parallel with
      esbuild to check types. This is not something esbuild does itself.

  - p: >
      TypeScript type declarations like these are parsed and ignored (a

  - h3: TypeScript caveats

  - p: >
      You should keep the following things in mind when using TypeScript with
      esbuild (in addition to the [JavaScript caveats](#javascript-caveats)):

  - h4#isolated-modules: Files are compiled independently
  - p: >
      Even when transpiling a single module, the TypeScript compiler actually
      still parses imported files so it can tell whether an imported name is
      a type or a value. However, tools like esbuild and Babel (and the
      TypeScript compiler's `transpileModule` API) compile each file in
      isolation so they can't tell if an imported name is a type or a value.
  - p: >
      Because of this, you should enable the [`isolatedModules`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#isolatedModules)
      TypeScript configuration option if you use TypeScript with esbuild.
      This option prevents you from using features which could cause mis-compilation
      in environments like esbuild where each file is compiled independently
      without tracing type references across files. For example, it prevents
      you from re-exporting types from another module using <code>export <wbr>{T} <wbr>from <wbr>'./types'</code>
      (you need to use <code>export <wbr>type <wbr>{T} <wbr>from <wbr>'./types'</code> instead).

  - h4#es-module-interop: Imports follow ECMAScript module behavior
  - p: >
      For historical reasons, the TypeScript compiler compiles ESM
      (ECMAScript module) syntax to CommonJS syntax by default. For example,
      <code>import *<wbr> as foo<wbr> from 'foo'</code> is compiled to
      <code>const foo =<wbr> require('foo')</code>. Presumably this happened
      because ECMAScript modules were still a proposal when TypeScript adopted
      the syntax. However, this is legacy behavior that doesn't match how this
      syntax behaves on real platforms such as node. For example, the `require`
      function can return any JavaScript value including a string but the
      `import * as` syntax always results in an object and cannot be a string.
  - p: >
      To avoid problems due to this legacy feature, you should enable the
      [`esModuleInterop`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#esModuleInterop)
      TypeScript configuration option if you use TypeScript with esbuild.
      Enabling it disables this legacy behavior and makes TypeScript's type
      system compatible with ESM. This option is not enabled by default because
      it would be a breaking change for existing TypeScript projects, but Microsoft
      [highly recommends applying it both to new and existing projects](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-7.html#support-for-import-d-from-cjs-from-commonjs-modules-with---esmoduleinterop)
      (and then updating your code) for better compatibility with the rest of the ecosystem.
  - p: >
      Specifically this means that importing a non-object value from a CommonJS
      module with ESM import syntax must be done using a default import instead
      of using `import * as`. So if a CommonJS module exports a function via
      <code>module.<wbr>exports =<wbr> fn</code>, you need to use
      <code>import <wbr>fn <wbr>from <wbr>'path'</code> instead of
      <code>import *<wbr> as<wbr> <wbr>fn <wbr>from <wbr>'path'</code>.

  - h4#no-type-system: Features that need a type system are not supported
  - p: >
      TypeScript types are treated as comments and are ignored by esbuild, so
      TypeScript is treated as "type-checked JavaScript." The interpretation of
      the type annotations is up to the TypeScript type checker, which you
      should be running in addition to esbuild if you're using TypeScript. This
      is the same compilation strategy that Babel's TypeScript implementation
      uses. However, it means that some TypeScript compilation features which
      require type interpretation to work do not work with esbuild.
  - p: >
      Specifically:
  - ul:
    - >
      <p>
      The [`emitDecoratorMetadata`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#emitDecoratorMetadata)
      TypeScript configuration option is not supported. This feature passes a
      JavaScript representation of the corresponding TypeScript type to the
      attached decorator function. Since esbuild does not replicate TypeScript's
      type system, it does not have enough information to implement this feature.
      </p>
    - >
      <p>
      The [`const enum`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html#const-enums)
      feature in TypeScript defines a set of compile-time constants grouped
      under a type. Each enum value of that type is replaced by the corresponding
      constant at compile time. Since esbuild does not replicate TypeScript's
      type system, `const enum` declarations are compiled as `enum` declarations
      instead.
      </p>

  - h4#tsconfig-json: Only certain `tsconfig.json` fields are respected
  - p: >
      During bundling, the path resolution algorithm in esbuild will consider
      the contents of the `tsconfig.json` file in the closest parent directory
      containing one and will modify its behavior accordingly. It is also
      possible to explicitly set the `tsconfig.json` path with the build API
      using esbuild's [`tsconfig`](/api/#tsconfig) setting and to explicitly pass in
      the contents of a `tsconfig.json` file with the transform API using esbuild's
      [`tsconfigRaw`](/api/#tsconfig-raw) setting. However, esbuild currently
      only inspects the following fields in `tsconfig.json` files:

  - ul:
    - >
      [`baseUrl`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#baseUrl)
    - >
      [`extends`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#extends)
    - >
      [`importsNotUsedAsValues`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#importsNotUsedAsValues)
    - >
      [`jsxFactory`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#jsxFactory)
    - >
      [`jsxFragmentFactory`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#jsxFragmentFactory)
    - >
      [`paths`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#paths)
    - >
      [`target`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#target)
    - >
      [`useDefineForClassFields`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#useDefineForClassFields)

  - p: >
      All other fields will be ignored. Note that import path
      transformation requires [`bundling`](/api/#bundle) to be enabled,
      since path resolution only happens during bundling.

  - h4#ts-vs-tsx: You cannot use the `tsx` loader for `*.ts` files
  - p: >
      The `tsx` loader is _not_ a superset of the `ts` loader. They are two
      different partially-incompatible syntaxes. For example, the character
      sequence `<a>1</a>/g` parses as `<a>(1 < (/a>/g))` with the `ts` loader
      and `(<a>1</a>) / g` with the `tsx` loader.
      </p>
      <p>The most common issue this causes is not being able to use generic
      type parameters on arrow function expressions such as `<T>() => {}`
      with the `tsx` loader. This is intentional, and matches the behavior of
      the official TypeScript compiler. That space in the `tsx` grammar is
      reserved for JSX elements.

  - h2: JSX
  - p: 'Loader: `jsx` or `tsx`'

  - p: >
      [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/) is an XML-like syntax extension
      for JavaScript that was created for [React](https://github.com/facebook/react).
      It's intended to be converted into normal JavaScript by your build tool.
      Each XML element becomes a normal JavaScript function call. For example,
      the following JSX code:

  - pre.jsx: |
      import Button from './button'
      let button = <Button>Click me</Button>
      render(button)

  - p: >
      Will be converted to the following JavaScript code:

  - pre.js: |
      import Button from "./button";
      let button = React.createElement(Button, null, "Click me");
      render(button);

  - p: >
      This loader is enabled by default for `.jsx` and `.tsx` files.
      Note that JSX syntax is not enabled in `.js` files by default. If you
      would like to enable that, you will need to configure it:

  - example:
      in:
        app.js: '<div/>'

      cli: |
        esbuild app.js --bundle --loader:.js=jsx

      js: |
        require('esbuild').buildSync({
          entryPoints: ['app.js'],
          bundle: true,
          loader: { '.js': 'jsx' },
          outfile: 'out.js',
        })

      go: |
        package main

        import "github.com/evanw/esbuild/pkg/api"
        import "os"

        func main() {
          result := api.Build(api.BuildOptions{
            EntryPoints: []string{"app.js"},
            Bundle:      true,
            Loader: map[string]api.Loader{
              ".js": api.LoaderJSX,
            },
            Write: true,
          })

          if len(result.Errors) > 0 {
            os.Exit(1)
          }
        }

  - h3: Auto-import for JSX

  - p: >
      Using JSX syntax usually requires you to manually import the JSX library
      you are using. For example, if you are using React, by default you will
      need to import React into each JSX file like this:

  - pre.jsx: |
      import * as React from 'react'
      render(<div/>)

  - p: >
      This is because the JSX transform turns JSX syntax into a call to
      <code>React.<wbr>createElement</code> but it does not itself import
      anything, so the `React` variable is not automatically present.

  - p: >
      If you would like to avoid having to manually `import` your JSX library
      into each file, you can use esbuild's [inject](/api/#inject) feature to
      automatically import it into every file. This feature is a general-purpose
      polyfill mechanism that replaces references to global variables with an
      export from the injected file. In this case we can use it to replace
      references to the `React` variable with exports from the `react` package.

  - p: >
      First, create a file called <code>react-<wbr>shim.js</code> that
      re-exports everything from the `react` package in an export called
      `React`:

  - pre.js: |
      // react-shim.js
      import * as React from 'react'
      export { React }

  - p: >
      Then use esbuild's [inject feature](/api/#inject) to inject this into
      each file:

  - example:
      in:
        react-shim.js: 'export let React = {createElement() {}}'
        app.jsx: 'console.log(<div/>)'

      cli: |
        esbuild app.jsx --bundle --inject:./react-shim.js --outfile=out.js

      js: |
        require('esbuild').buildSync({
          entryPoints: ['app.jsx'],
          bundle: true,
          inject: ['./react-shim.js'],
          outfile: 'out.js',
        })

      go: |
        package main

        import "github.com/evanw/esbuild/pkg/api"
        import "os"

        func main() {
          result := api.Build(api.BuildOptions{
            EntryPoints: []string{"app.jsx"},
            Bundle:      true,
            Inject:      []string{"./react-shim.js"},
            Outfile:     "out.js",
            Write:       true,
          })

          if len(result.Errors) > 0 {
            os.Exit(1)
          }
        }

  - p: >
      Since the inject feature is a general-purpose code injection mechanism,
      it can be used with any JSX transform library, not just with React.

  - p: >
      **Important:**
      The `export` statement is required. Do not remove it. The inject feature
      injects an `import` statement to `react-shim.js` at the top of each file
      that looks like this:

  - pre.js: |
      import { /* ... */ } from './react-shim.js'

  - p: >
      The set of imported names `/* ... */` is automatically generated from
      the set of unbound references in the file (i.e. `React`) that are equal
      to the name of an export of the injected file `react-shim.js`. If the
      injected file doesn't export anything, then the set of imported names
      stays empty and all unbound references all stay unbound. Code with
      unbound references to `React` will crash at run-time if there is no
      variable called `React` in the global scope. This is by design, and
      happens because of to how ECMAScript modules work. Imports in one module
      are local to that module and cannot be read from other modules unless
      they have been exported by that module and imported into the other module.
      Using `export` in `react-shim.js` with the local variable `React` allows
      it to be imported into and used by other modules.

  - h3: Using JSX without React

  - p: >
      If you're using JSX with a library other than React (such as
      [Preact](https://preactjs.com/)), you'll likely need to configure the
      [JSX factory](/api/#jsx-factory) and [JSX fragment](/api/#jsx-fragment)
      settings since they default to <code>React<wbr>.createElement</code> and
      <code>React<wbr>.Fragment</code> respectively:

  - example:
      in:
        app.jsx: '<div/>'

      cli: |
        esbuild app.jsx --jsx-factory=h --jsx-fragment=Fragment

      js: |
        require('esbuild').buildSync({
          entryPoints: ['app.jsx'],
          jsxFactory: 'h',
          jsxFragment: 'Fragment',
          outfile: 'out.js',
        })

      go: |
        package main

        import "github.com/evanw/esbuild/pkg/api"
        import "os"

        func main() {
          result := api.Build(api.BuildOptions{
            EntryPoints: []string{"app.jsx"},
            JSXFactory:  "h",
            JSXFragment: "Fragment",
            Write:       true,
          })

          if len(result.Errors) > 0 {
            os.Exit(1)
          }
        }

  - p: >
      Alternatively, if you are using TypeScript, you can just configure JSX
      for TypeScript by adding this to your `tsconfig.json` file and esbuild
      should pick it up automatically without needing to be configured:

  - pre.json: |
      {
        "compilerOptions": {
          "jsxFactory": "h",
          "jsxFragmentFactory": "Fragment"
        }
      }

  - p: >
      You will also have to add <code>import <wbr>{h, <wbr>Fragment} <wbr>from <wbr>'preact'</code>
      in files containing JSX syntax unless you use auto-importing as described above.

  - h2: JSON
  - div: 'Loader: `json`'

  - p: >
      This loader is enabled by default for `.json` files. It parses the JSON
      file into a JavaScript object at build time and exports the object as
      the default export. Using it looks something like this:

  - pre.js: |
      import object from './example.json'
      console.log(object)

  - p: >
      In addition to the default export, there are also named exports for each
      top-level property in the JSON object. Importing a named export directly
      means esbuild can automatically remove unused parts of the JSON file from
      the bundle, leaving only the named exports that you actually used. For
      example, this code will only include the `version` field when bundled:

  - pre.js: |
      import { version } from './package.json'
      console.log(version)

  - h2: CSS
  - p: 'Loader: `css`'

  - warning: >
      The CSS content type is new and is still a work in progress. There is
      also a known [ordering issue](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/465)
      with importing CSS files from JavaScript files. You can follow
      [the tracking issue](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/20)
      for updates about this feature.

  - p: >
      This loader is enabled by default for `.css` files. It loads the file
      as CSS syntax. CSS is a first-class content type in esbuild, which means
      esbuild can bundle CSS files directly without needing to import your CSS
      from JavaScript code:

  - example:
      in:
        app.css: 'body {}'

      cli: |
        esbuild --bundle app.css --outfile=out.css

      js: |
        require('esbuild').buildSync({
          entryPoints: ['app.css'],
          bundle: true,
          outfile: 'out.css',
        })

      go: |
        package main

        import "github.com/evanw/esbuild/pkg/api"
        import "os"

        func main() {
          result := api.Build(api.BuildOptions{
            EntryPoints: []string{"app.css"},
            Bundle:      true,
            Outfile:     "out.css",
            Write:       true,
          })

          if len(result.Errors) > 0 {
            os.Exit(1)
          }
        }

  - p: >
      You can `@import` other CSS files and reference image and font files with
      `url()` and esbuild will bundle everything together. Note that you will
      have to configure a loader for image and font files, since esbuild
      doesn't have any pre-configured. Usually this is either the
      [data URL](#data-url) loader or the [external file](#external-file) loader.

  - p: >
      You can also import CSS from JavaScript. When you do this, esbuild will
      gather all CSS files referenced from a given entry point and bundle it
      into a sibling CSS output file next to the JavaScript output file for
      that JavaScript entry point. So if esbuild generates `app.js` it would
      also generate `app.css` containing all CSS files referenced by `app.js`.
      Here's an example of importing a CSS file from JavaScript:

  - pre.jsx: |
      import './button.css'

      export let Button = ({ text }) =>
        <div className="button">{text}</div>

  - p: >
      Note that esbuild doesn't yet support CSS modules, so the set of export
      names from a CSS file is currently always empty. Supporting a basic form
      of CSS modules is on the roadmap.

  - h2: Text
  - p: 'Loader: `text`'

  - p: >
      This loader is enabled by default for `.txt` files. It loads the file
      as a string at build time and exports the string as the default export.
      Using it looks something like this:

  - pre.js: |
      import string from './example.txt'
      console.log(string)

  - h2: Binary
  - p: 'Loader: `binary`'

  - p: >
      This loader will load the file as a binary buffer at build time and
      embed it into the bundle using Base64 encoding. The original bytes of
      the file are decoded from Base64 at run time and exported as a
      `Uint8Array` using the default export. Using it looks like this:

  - pre.js: |
      import uint8array from './example.data'
      console.log(uint8array)

  - p: >
      If you need an `ArrayBuffer` instead, you can just access
      <code>uint8array<wbr>.buffer</code>. Note that this loader is not
      enabled by default. You will need to configure it for the appropriate
      file extension like this:

  - example:
      in:
        app.js: |
          import uint8array from './example.data'
          console.log(uint8array)
        example.data: |
          this is some data

      cli: |
        esbuild app.js --bundle --loader:.data=binary

      js: |
        require('esbuild').buildSync({
          entryPoints: ['app.js'],
          bundle: true,
          loader: { '.data': 'binary' },
          outfile: 'out.js',
        })

      go: |
        package main

        import "github.com/evanw/esbuild/pkg/api"

        func main() {
          result := api.Build(api.BuildOptions{
            EntryPoints: []string{"app.js"},
            Bundle:      true,
            Loader: map[string]api.Loader{
              ".data": api.LoaderBinary,
            },
            Write: true,
          })

          if len(result.Errors) > 0 {
            os.Exit(1)
          }
        }

  - h2: Base64
  - p: 'Loader: `base64`'

  - p: >
      This loader will load the file as a binary buffer at build time and
      embed it into the bundle as a string using Base64 encoding. This
      string is exported using the default export. Using it looks like this:

  - pre.js: |
      import base64string from './example.data'
      console.log(base64string)

  - p: >
      Note that this loader is not enabled by default. You will need to
      configure it for the appropriate file extension like this:

        }

  - p: >
      If you intend to turn this into a `Uint8Array` or an `ArrayBuffer`, you
      should use the `binary` loader instead. It uses an optimized
      Base64-to-binary converter that is faster than the usual `atob`
      conversion process.

  - h2: Data URL
  - p: 'Loader: `dataurl`'

  - p: >
      This loader will load the file as a binary buffer at build time and

      By default the exported string is just the file name. If you would like to
      prepend a base path to the exported string, this can be done with the
      [public path](/api/#public-path) API option.
