title: Content Types
body:
  - h1: Content Types
  - p: >
      All of the built-in content types are listed below. Each content type
      has an associated "loader" which tells esbuild how to interpret the
      file contents. Some file extensions already have a loader configured
      for them by default, although the defaults can be overridden.

  - h2: JavaScript
  - p: 'Loader: `js`'

  - p: >
      This loader is enabled by default for `.js`, `.cjs`, and `.mjs` files.
      The `.cjs` extension is used by node for CommonJS modules and the `.mjs`
      extension is used by node for ECMAScript modules, although esbuild
      doesn't make a distinction between the two.

  - p: >
      All modern JavaScript syntax is supported by esbuild. Newer syntax may
      not be supported by older browsers, however, so you may want to
      configure the [target](/api/#target) option to tell esbuild to convert
      newer syntax to older syntax as appropriate.

  - p: >
      These syntax features are always transformed for older browsers:

      Some additional details:

  - ul:
    - >
      **ES5 support**
      <p>
      Transforming ES6+ syntax to ES5 is not supported yet. However, if you're
      using esbuild to transform ES5 code, you should still set the
      [target](/api/#target) to `es5`. This prevents esbuild from introducing
      ES6 syntax into your ES5 code. For example, without this flag the object
      literal `{x: x}` will become `{x}` and the string `"a\nb"` will become
      a multi-line template literal when minifying. Both of these substitutions
      are done because the resulting code is shorter, but the substitutions
      will not be performed if the [target](/api/#target) is `es5`.
      </p>

    - >
      **Private member performance**
      <p>
      The private member transform (for the `#name` syntax) uses `WeakMap` and
      `WeakSet` to preserve the privacy properties of this feature. This is
      similar to the corresponding transforms in the Babel and TypeScript
      compilers. Most modern JavaScript engines (V8, JavaScriptCore, and
      SpiderMonkey but not ChakraCore) may not have good performance
      characteristics for large `WeakMap` and `WeakSet` objects.
      </p>
      <p>
      Creating many instances of classes with private fields or private
      methods with this syntax transform active may cause a lot of overhead
      for the garbage collector.
      This is because modern engines (other than ChakraCore) store weak
      values in an actual map object instead of as hidden properties on the
      keys themselves, and large map objects can cause performance issues with
      garbage collection. See [this reference](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/issues/1657#issuecomment-518916579)
      for more information.
      </p>

  - h2: TypeScript
  - p: 'Loader: `ts` or `tsx`'

  - p: >
      This loader is enabled by default for `.ts` and `.tsx` files, which
      means esbuild has built-in support for parsing TypeScript syntax and
      discarding the type annotations. However, esbuild _does not_ do any type
      checking so you will still need to run `tsc -noEmit` in parallel with
      esbuild to check types. This is not something esbuild does itself.

  - p: >
      TypeScript type declarations like these are parsed and ignored (a
      non-exhaustive list):

  - p: >
      Some additional caveats:

  - ul:
    - >
        <p>
        You should probably enable the [`isolatedModules`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#isolatedModules)
        TypeScript configuration option if you use TypeScript with esbuild.
        This prevents you from using features which could cause mis-compilation
        in environments like esbuild where each file is compiled independently
        without tracing type references across files. For example, it prevents
        you from re-exporting types from another module using <code>export <wbr>{T} <wbr>from <wbr>'./types'</code>
        (you need to use <code>export <wbr>type <wbr>{T} <wbr>from <wbr>'./types'</code> instead).
        </p>

    - >
        <p>
        You should probably also enable the [`esModuleInterop`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#esModuleInterop)
        TypeScript configuration option if you use TypeScript with esbuild.
        Enabling it disables some TypeScript-specific behavior that goes against
        the ECMAScript language specification and causes compatibility problems
        with many tools including esbuild. Specifically it means that if a
        CommonJS module exports a function via <code>module.<wbr>exports =<wbr> fn</code>,
        you need to use <code>import <wbr>fn <wbr>from <wbr>'path'</code>
        instead of <code>import *<wbr> as<wbr> <wbr>fn <wbr>from <wbr>'path'</code>.
        This option is not enabled by default because it would be a breaking change
        for existing TypeScript projects, but Microsoft
        [highly recommends applying it both to new and existing projects](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-7.html#support-for-import-d-from-cjs-from-commonjs-modules-with---esmoduleinterop)
        (and then updating your code) for better compatibility with the rest of the ecosystem.

    - >
        <p>
        The [`emitDecoratorMetadata`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#emitDecoratorMetadata)
        TypeScript configuration option is not supported. It passes type
        annotations to decorators and is an exception to the "TypeScript
        is just JavaScript" philosophy that TypeScript started with where
        type annotations are not supposed to change the output of the
        compiler. Since esbuild does not replicate TypeScript's type system,
        it does not have enough information to implement this feature.
        </p>

    - >
        <p>
        The `tsx` loader is _not_ a superset of the `ts` loader. They are two
        different partially-incompatible syntaxes. For example, the character
        sequence `<a>1</a>/g` parses as `<a>(1 < (/a>/g))` with the `ts` loader
        and `(<a>1</a>) / g` with the `tsx` loader.
        </p>
        <p>The most common issue this causes is not being able to use generic
        type parameters on arrow function expressions such as `<T>() => {}`
        with the `tsx` loader. This is intentional, and matches the behavior of
        the official TypeScript compiler. That space in the `tsx` grammar is
        reserved for JSX elements.
        </p>

  - h2: JSX
  - p: 'Loader: `jsx` or `tsx`'

  - p: >
      [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/) is an XML-like syntax extension
      for JavaScript that was created for [React](https://github.com/facebook/react).
      It's intended to be converted into normal JavaScript by your build tool.
      Each XML element becomes a normal JavaScript function call. For example,
      the following JSX code:

  - pre.jsx: |
      import Button from './button'
      let button = <Button>Click me</Button>
      render(button)

  - p: >
      Will be converted to the following JavaScript code:

  - pre.js: |
      import Button from "./button";
      let button = React.createElement(Button, null, "Click me");
      render(button);

  - p: >
      This loader is enabled by default for `.jsx` and `.tsx` files.
      Note that JSX syntax is not enabled in `.js` files by default. If you
      would like to enable that, you will need to configure it:

  - example:
      in:
        app.js: '<div/>'

      cli: |
        esbuild app.js --bundle --loader:.js=jsx

      js: |
        require('esbuild').buildSync({
          entryPoints: ['app.js'],
          bundle: true,
          loader: { '.js': 'jsx' },
          outfile: 'out.js',
        })

      go: |
        package main

        import "github.com/evanw/esbuild/pkg/api"
        import "os"

        func main() {
          result := api.Build(api.BuildOptions{
            EntryPoints: []string{"app.js"},
            Bundle:      true,
            Loader: map[string]api.Loader{
              ".js": api.LoaderJSX,
            },
            Write: true,
          })

          if len(result.Errors) > 0 {
            os.Exit(1)
          }
        }

  - h3: Auto-import for JSX

  - p: >
      Using JSX syntax usually requires you to manually import the JSX library
      you are using. For example, if you are using React, by default you will
      need to import React into each JSX file like this:

  - pre.jsx: |
      import * as React from 'react'
      render(<div/>)

  - p: >
      This is because the JSX transform turns JSX syntax into a call to
      <code>React.<wbr>createElement</code> but it does not itself import
      anything, so the `React` variable is not automatically present.

  - p: >
      If you would like to avoid having to manually `import` your JSX library
      into each file, you can use esbuild's [inject](/api/#inject) feature to
      automatically import it into every file. This feature is a general-purpose
      polyfill mechanism that replaces references to global variables with an
      export from the injected file. In this case we can use it to replace
      references to the `React` variable with exports from the `react` package.

  - p: >
      First, create a file called <code>react-<wbr>shim.js</code> that
      re-exports everything from the `react` package in an export called
      `React`:

  - pre.js: |
      // react-shim.js
      export * as React from 'react'

  - p: >
      Then use esbuild's inject feature to inject this into each file:

  - example:
      in:
        react-shim.js: 'export let React = {createElement() {}}'
        app.jsx: 'console.log(<div/>)'

      cli: |
        esbuild app.jsx --bundle --inject:./react-shim.js --outfile=out.js

      js: |
        require('esbuild').buildSync({
          entryPoints: ['app.jsx'],
          bundle: true,
          inject: ['./react-shim.js'],
          outfile: 'out.js',
        })

      go: |
        package main

        import "github.com/evanw/esbuild/pkg/api"
        import "os"

        func main() {
          result := api.Build(api.BuildOptions{
            EntryPoints: []string{"app.jsx"},
            Bundle:      true,
            Inject:      []string{"./react-shim.js"},
            Outfile:     "out.js",
            Write:       true,
          })

          if len(result.Errors) > 0 {
            os.Exit(1)
          }
        }

  - p: >
      Since the inject feature is a general-purpose code injection mechanism,
      it can be used with any JSX transform library, not just with React.

  - h3: Using JSX without React

  - p: >
      If you're using JSX with a library other than React (such as
      [Preact](https://preactjs.com/)), you'll likely need to configure the
      [JSX factory](/api/#jsx-factory) and [JSX fragment](/api/#jsx-fragment)
      settings since they default to <code>React<wbr>.createElement</code> and
      <code>React<wbr>.Fragment</code> respectively:

  - example:
      in:
        app.jsx: '<div/>'

      cli: |
        esbuild app.jsx --jsx-factory=h --jsx-fragment=Fragment

      js: |
        require('esbuild').buildSync({
          entryPoints: ['app.jsx'],
          jsxFactory: 'h',
          jsxFragment: 'Fragment',
          outfile: 'out.js',
        })

      go: |
        package main

        import "github.com/evanw/esbuild/pkg/api"
        import "os"

        func main() {
          result := api.Build(api.BuildOptions{
            EntryPoints: []string{"app.jsx"},
            JSXFactory:  "h",
            JSXFragment: "Fragment",
            Write:       true,
          })

          if len(result.Errors) > 0 {
            os.Exit(1)
          }
        }

  - p: >
      Alternatively, if you are using TypeScript, you can just configure JSX
      for TypeScript by adding this to your `tsconfig.json` file and esbuild
      should pick it up automatically without needing to be configured:

  - pre.json: |
      {
        "compilerOptions": {
          "jsxFactory": "h",
          "jsxFragmentFactory": "Fragment"
        }
      }

      You will also have to add <code>import <wbr>{h, <wbr>Fragment} <wbr>from <wbr>'preact'</code>
      in files containing JSX syntax unless you use auto-importing as described above.

  - h2: JSON
  - div: 'Loader: `json`'

  - p: >
      This loader is enabled by default for `.json` files. It parses the JSON
      file into a JavaScript object at build time and exports the object as
      the default export. Using it looks something like this:

  - pre.js: |
      import object from './example.json'
      console.log(object)

  - p: >
      In addition to the default export, there are also named exports for each
      top-level property in the JSON object. Importing a named export directly
      means esbuild can automatically remove unused parts of the JSON file from
      the bundle, leaving only the named exports that you actually used. For
      example, this code will only include the `version` field when bundled:

  - pre.js: |
      import { version } from './package.json'
      console.log(version)

  - h2: CSS
  - p: 'Loader: `css`'

  - warning: >
      The CSS content type is new and is still a work in progress. There is
      also a known [ordering issue](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/465)
      with importing CSS files from JavaScript files. You can follow
      [the tracking issue](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/20)
      for updates about this feature.

  - p: >
      This loader is enabled by default for `.css` files. It loads the file
      as CSS syntax. CSS is a first-class content type in esbuild, which means
      esbuild can bundle CSS files directly without needing to import your CSS
      from JavaScript code:

  - example:
      in:
        app.css: 'body {}'

      cli: |
        esbuild --bundle app.css --outfile=out.css

      js: |
        require('esbuild').buildSync({
          entryPoints: ['app.css'],
          bundle: true,
          outfile: 'out.css',
        })

      go: |
        package main

        import "github.com/evanw/esbuild/pkg/api"
        import "os"

        func main() {
          result := api.Build(api.BuildOptions{
            EntryPoints: []string{"app.css"},
            Bundle:      true,
            Outfile:     "out.css",
            Write:       true,
          })

          if len(result.Errors) > 0 {
            os.Exit(1)
          }
        }

  - p: >
      You can `@import` other CSS files and reference image and font files with
      `url()` and esbuild will bundle everything together. Note that you will
      have to configure a loader for image and font files, since esbuild
      doesn't have any pre-configured. Usually this is either the
      [data URL](#data-url) loader or the [external file](#external-file) loader.

  - p: >
      You can also import CSS from JavaScript. When you do this, esbuild will
      gather all CSS files referenced from a given entry point and bundle it
      into a sibling CSS output file next to the JavaScript output file for
      that JavaScript entry point. So if esbuild generates `app.js` it would
      also generate `app.css` containing all CSS files referenced by `app.js`.
      Here's an example of importing a CSS file from JavaScript:

  - pre.jsx: |
      import './button.css'

      export let Button = ({ text }) =>
        <div className="button">{text}</div>

  - p: >
      Note that esbuild doesn't yet support CSS modules, so the set of export
      names from a CSS file is currently always empty. Supporting a basic form
      of CSS modules is on the roadmap.

  - h2: Text
  - p: 'Loader: `text`'

  - p: >
      This loader is enabled by default for `.txt` files. It loads the file
      as a string at build time and exports the string as the default export.
      Using it looks something like this:

  - pre.js: |
      import string from './example.txt'
      console.log(string)

  - h2: Binary
  - p: 'Loader: `binary`'

  - p: >
      This loader will load the file as a binary buffer at build time and
      embed it into the bundle using Base64 encoding. The original bytes of
      the file are decoded from Base64 at run time and exported as a
      `Uint8Array` using the default export. Using it looks like this:

  - pre.js: |
      import uint8array from './example.data'
      console.log(uint8array)

  - p: >
      If you need an `ArrayBuffer` instead, you can just access
      <code>uint8array<wbr>.buffer</code>. Note that this loader is not
      enabled by default. You will need to configure it for the appropriate
      file extension like this:

  - example:
      in:
        app.js: |
          import uint8array from './example.data'
          console.log(uint8array)
        example.data: |
          this is some data

      cli: |
        esbuild app.js --bundle --loader:.data=binary

      js: |
        require('esbuild').buildSync({
          entryPoints: ['app.js'],
          bundle: true,
          loader: { '.data': 'binary' },
          outfile: 'out.js',
        })

      go: |
        package main

        import "github.com/evanw/esbuild/pkg/api"
        import "os"

        func main() {
          result := api.Build(api.BuildOptions{
            EntryPoints: []string{"app.js"},
            Bundle:      true,
            Loader: map[string]api.Loader{
              ".data": api.LoaderBinary,
            },
            Write: true,
          })

          if len(result.Errors) > 0 {
            os.Exit(1)
          }
        }

  - h2: Base64
  - p: 'Loader: `base64`'

  - p: >
      This loader will load the file as a binary buffer at build time and
      embed it into the bundle as a string using Base64 encoding. This
      string is exported using the default export. Using it looks like this:

  - pre.js: |
      import base64string from './example.data'
      console.log(base64string)

  - p: >
      Note that this loader is not enabled by default. You will need to
      configure it for the appropriate file extension like this:

  - example:
      in:
        app.js: |
          import base64string from './example.data'
          console.log(base64string)
        example.data: |
          this is some data

      cli: |
        esbuild app.js --bundle --loader:.data=base64

      js: |
        require('esbuild').buildSync({
          entryPoints: ['app.js'],
          bundle: true,
          loader: { '.data': 'base64' },
          outfile: 'out.js',
        })

      go: |
        package main

        import "github.com/evanw/esbuild/pkg/api"
        import "os"

        func main() {
          result := api.Build(api.BuildOptions{
            EntryPoints: []string{"app.js"},
            Bundle:      true,
            Loader: map[string]api.Loader{
              ".data": api.LoaderBase64,
            },
            Write: true,
          })

          if len(result.Errors) > 0 {
            os.Exit(1)
          }
        }

  - p: >
      If you intend to turn this into a `Uint8Array` or an `ArrayBuffer`, you
      should use the `binary` loader instead. It uses an optimized
      Base64-to-binary converter that is faster than the usual `atob`
      conversion process.

  - h2: Data URL
  - p: 'Loader: `dataurl`'

  - p: >
      This loader will load the file as a binary buffer at build time and
      embed it into the bundle as a Base64-encoded data URL. This string is
      exported using the default export. Using it looks like this:

  - pre.js: |
      import url from './example.png'
      let image = new Image
      image.src = url
      document.body.appendChild(image)

  - p: >
      The data URL includes a best guess at the MIME type based on the file
      extension and/or the file contents, and will look something like this:

  - pre: |
      data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgo=

  - p: >
      Note that this loader is not enabled by default. You will need to
      configure it for the appropriate file extension like this:

  - example:
      in:
        app.js: |
          import url from './example.png'
          let image = new Image
          image.src = url
          document.body.appendChild(image)
        example.png: |
          this is some data

      cli: |
        esbuild app.js --bundle --loader:.png=dataurl

      js: |
        require('esbuild').buildSync({
          entryPoints: ['app.js'],
          bundle: true,
          loader: { '.png': 'dataurl' },

  - h2: External file
  - p: 'Loader: `file`'

  - p: >
      This loader will copy the file to the output directory and embed the
      file name into the bundle as a string. This string is exported using
      the default export. Using it looks like this:

      image.src = url
      document.body.appendChild(image)

  - p: >
      By default the exported string is just the file name. If you would like to
      prepend a base path to the exported string, this can be done with the
      [public path](/api/#public-path) API option.
